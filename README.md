# Recipes Project
This is my Recipes Project for The Odin Project. I will come back to this at some point to write a reflection on the creation process of the recipe site.

## New Git Commit Message Standard
I will be using a new message standard on my git commit messages from here until I find I better way to write them, but now I'll be making sure that there is a subject and a body, with new lines when the body starts to run on too long.
On second look, it appears that all I need to do is seperate out the subject and the body, GitHub does the rest automatically. I'll have to circle back and see if I can't come up with a better format, but for now I'll use:
git commit -m "Subject Text will go here" -m "Body text will follow, not adding in any new lines because GitHub seems to handle it automatically."
