# Recipes Project
This is my Recipes Project for The Odin Project. I will come back to this at some point to write a reflection on the creation process of the recipe site.

## New Git Commit Message Standard
I will be using a new message standard on my git commit messages from here until I find I better way to write them, but now I'll be making sure that there is a subject and a body, with new lines when the body starts to run on too long.
